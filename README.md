# Pandas_Challenges

This repository contains a set of challenges to test your knowledge of pandas. The challenges are divided into three levels of difficulty: beginner, intermediate, and advanced.

### My Take
- I will not use ChatGPT or any other chatbot to help me complete the 100 pandas puzzles and I will disable github copilot and cody so that I can focus on the puzzles.
- I will answer them the old fashion way trial and error and if I get stuck I will use github and stackoverflow to find the answers.
